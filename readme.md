AngularJS exercise created July-August 2014 by Mandi Grant.

This recipe site was built from AngularJS Seed and a whole lot of custom HTML, CSS and .json data. Recipe data is fed into it in .json format and displayed using Angular controllers and routes. 

Includes a custom built CMS that lets the user add new recipes, edit existing recipes, and delete unwanted recipes.
