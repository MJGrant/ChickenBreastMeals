<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We are a married couple who love to eat.  Note that we said "eat", not "cook". We like the results of cooking far more than we like actually cooking, so these recipes tend to be light on labor and big on yum. We eat a lot of chicken breast - usually once or twice a day. The recipes you find here are our favorites, perfected over many years and designed to be quick to make and tasy to eat. We hope you enjoy!</p>
